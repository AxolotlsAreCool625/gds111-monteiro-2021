        <p>
            I am 18, I have four family members, and I have multiple pets consisting of 3 cats, 2 dogs, 2 birds, and 2 geckos. I live in Massachusetts Framingham, but I currently reside in the Resident hall as it is an hour and half trip from NEIT to my home.

            I got into Video Game Development because I have ideas for games that I want to see created, and enjoyed by many people. It is a passion for me, as I have seen many people do this, and want to contribute to a past time I also participate in frequently. I also constantly daydream about little parts of a game I'd like to fully flesh out, and it bothers me that I keep thinking of them, but am unable to do anything with these ideas.
