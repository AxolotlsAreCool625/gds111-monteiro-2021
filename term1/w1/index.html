            My full name is Jonathan Joel Monteiro. Many people like to refer to me as John, and while I don't mind it, I do prefer to go by Jonathan instead. My favorite color is Emerald Green, yet most of the things I own tend to be red. I hope to one day make a video game that many people will enjoy.

            I have an issue with burnout and procrastination, and am trying to get over it. Writing code is an area of work I find entertaining, yet thankfully not a hobby, as this way I can enjoy work without it mixing with my personal hobbies. I get excited when code I write works, as it feels as if I have created something.
